## 1. Linux uppsetning

I had the Linux (Ubuntu 12.04) installed on forehand as a dual boot. I am nothing close to a super user but have been trying this out for few years mostly for music player on old laptops.

## 2. Uppsetning á vim && git

The two tools were easy to install, the only thing to do was run the commands in the terminal and wait.

## 3. Unnið með Git (1. hluti)

This was hard to use as I got an error on every command I used so to master this I will have to spend some more time on this. Link to project is:

## 4. Uppsettur hugbúnaður

The programs I am running that are Open source are:
Ubuntu 12.04 (had it before this assignment bud I am not superuser). The linux kernel source code can be found (did not try) by: apt-get source linux-source-3.2.0 and the Ubuntu Source code is here http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ ( see for source: http://askubuntu.com/questions/167468/where-can-i-find-the-source-code-of-ubuntu)

## 5. Unnið með Git (2. hluti)

Hér þarf ekkert að gera annað en að setja niðurstöður úr 4. fyrstu liðunum inn í þetta skjal.
